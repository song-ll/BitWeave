# BitWeave
Sensor deployment topology generates Neural Network 3D image and detection, Matlab algorithm model computing and abstrction, clould database retrive MASK match for bio security authentication and parameter collection and characterization.
VHDL is the launguage to program the FPGA. 
State machine will track the application operating state.
Entity diagram to identify vhdl class to program each object.
uart clock frequency need to be match to FPGA clocks
GPIO need to assigned matching Audrino port.
